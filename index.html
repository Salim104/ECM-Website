            <p>
              Most of my upbringing was an intense roller coaster of emotions.
              From drowning with thoughts of anxiety, self-doubt, and consistent
              profound ideas of just ending it all, I often felt I had sunken
              deep in the ocean of pain and worthlessnessm, I can still remember
              vividly at age 14 when I had been contemplating for months to take
              my life.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="myStory-text">
          <p>
            I cried myself to sleep almost every-single-day, waking up the next
            day with the most innocent gratitude that I had made it to the next
            day, while in contrast, deep down, I knew I just wanted to end it
            all. I had had enough, enough of crying, enough of hoping and
            longing that my life should have turned out differently.
          </p>

          <p>
            This constant and fervent feeling that my life was harder than that
            of anyone else, laid so heavy on my shoulders that enjoying life was
            almost impossible. And living in a society in which avoiding pain or
            suffering in silence is seen as a sign of strength, sharing this
            with anyone else was not ideal. My strongest desire was to
            experience a community that did not only see me but heard me, a
            community that assured me that I was not alone and that I too had a
            story that mattered. After countless efforts of trying to explain
            who I am or why I thought the way I did, I felt more alone and
            eventually had to shrink my truest self to fit in in a place that
            was never meant for me anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            For that reason, every conversation matters was born. I felt the
            urge so profound to start an organisation (ECM) that allows for a
            safe space for people to voice out, speak their thoughts openly and
            encounter their power through their own story. Because just like
            myself, people are longing for a community that not only sees them
            but hears them, a community that assures them that they too are not
            alone. And Every Conversation Matters advocates for exactly that.

            Every Conversation Matters (ECM) is an organisation which provides
            the platform for people to have real, profound, and stories of
            impact. We give individuals the power to tell their own story and
            the chance to make their voices heard. Our main goal is to Inspire
            and Empower individuals to Win in life by owning up to their true
            selves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to have the conversations we engage in, and the
            message of inspiration and empowerment shared weekly, to help people
            navigate their way around the difficulties they are faced with
            daily. ECM believes in the spirit of self-transformation and
            embraces the power of individuals rising towards their true purpose
            while being unapologetically themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            We advocate for a community of impact and are driven by the profound
            transformation of individuals who meet their power and use their
            stories to give hope to others.
